User Perspective:

  This program is an educational tool for middle schoolers to learn basic information
  about US states. It can read in files from the command line or manually after the 
  executable has run. It has five options. It can list all the information read in from
  the CSV file given. It can print the year any given state joined the union. It can 
  list all of the states in ascending order based on the year they joined the union. It
  also has two test modes. The user can guess states based on given capitals, or guess
  capitals based on given states.

Programmer Perspective:

  This program is split into 3 files with 8 functions and main, with argc and argv[] from
  the command line and a struct declared in the header file. The program is mainly run
  through a while and switch statement in main, looping through the display and choices
  and calling the correct functions from the function file as needed.

Evaluations:

  Began by planning higher level code and then worked on lower level functions. Started
  with properly reading in and printing the information from the CSV file, then expanded
  to manipulate the data and create the other modes. Created the bubble sort last as that
  was the most difficult. Ran into a problem where the struct would permanently change
  after being sorted, and overcame this challenge by storing the states struct into a
  seperate struct before performing the sort. I compiled often and solved syntax and logic
  errors as I went. After the program ran with no errors, I manually checked each operation
  and verified the display and errors outputted at the right time.
