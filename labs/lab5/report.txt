User Perspective:

  This program creates, manages, and displays various operations on 
  a simple text-based database. It asks the user to read in sayings
  from a pre-existing text file, then allows for the user to add
  more sayings to the database, search for sayings based on key words
  or phrases, and allows the user to print and save all of the data 
  on a new text file.

Programmer Perspective:

  The program uses 6 functions along with main to set up read and write
  file pointers along with all of the operations on the database. It
  reprints the display and asks the user for their desired choice after
  every action, using a switch statment to call and run the necessary
  functions.

Evaluation:

  Created the program in parts, recompiling and resolving syntax errors
  as I went. Planned higher level code first, organized large problem
  into smaller problems with their own functions, and then solved smaller
  problems with lower level code. After program ran with no syntax errors,
  evaluated for logic errors by manually checking each operation. Also
  manually verified that display and errors outputted at the right time.
