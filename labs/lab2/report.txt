// Lab Report for Lab 2
// By: Arda Kurama

User Perspective:

	This program creates a vertical graph using ASCII characters for the graph:

		y = 2sin(x)cos(2x) + 3

	This function is hard coded into the program and is displayed between x = 0.0 and
	x = 20.0, as shown in the first line at the top of the graph. After the graph has
	been printed its (x, y) values of its maximum and minimum are displayed.

Programmer Perspective:

	This program uses printf to display hardcoded function and its range.
	Function initializes yMin and yMax to compare to y values later. Program then
	loops from 0.0 - 20.0 in 0.1 increments and recalculates y for each increment. 
	If y = 0, a "*" is printed. If y > yMax, the x and y values for that maximum are
	stored in xMax and yMax. If y < yMin, the x and y values for that minimum are stored
	in xMin and yMin. While y > 0, a "#" is displayed for each 0.1 increment of y to
	give a visual representation of the function in ASCII characters. The (x, y) 
	values of the maximum and minimum of the function on its range are then shown.

Evaluation:

	Created program in parts, recompiling and resolving syntax errors as I went. After
	function ran with no syntax errors, evaluated for logic errors by manually calculating
	the (x, y) values for the maximum and minimum of the function. Also verified "#" plot
	by comparing it to a plot of the same function on a graphing calculator. There are no
	cases in the hardcoded range for the hardcoded function where the program produces 
	incorrect results, but ASCII plot would have to be changed to showcase negative 
	values on different functions.
