User Perspective:

	This program displays and runs a working 4-function calculator to help verify 3rd-grade
	math skills. It asks the user what they would like to do, and gives five options for
	addition (1), for subtraction (2), for multiplication (3), for division (4), and to exit
	(5). After entering your choice, it asks the user what two numbers they would like to
	use in the calculation. The program then displays the correct calculation. If a user
	enters an integer outside of 1-5, the program displays an error message. If the user
	attempts to divide by 0, the program displays an error message. The program continues to
	display and prompt for calculations until a 5 is entered for the initial choice.

Programmer Perspective:

	This program uses five functions along with main to run the program. It is mainly driven
	through a while loop in main that calls various functions until a 5 is entered for choice.
	The program first calls display(), decides whether choice was inside range 1-5, then calls
	the calc(int) function, where a switch function decides which operation function to call
	based on the inputted choice. In calc(int), the program asks for the two numbers to input,
	and sends the numbers to the correct function to do the correct calculation, along with
	outputting the answer with printf(). 

Evaulation:

	Created program in parts, recompiling and resolving syntax errors as I went. Organized code
	through functions, which made coding higher level much easier without getting bogged down by
	lower level code. After function ran with no syntax errors, evaluated for logic errors by
	manually calculating each operation. Specifically checked for all edge cases, and manually 
	verified that the display and errors were outputted at the right time and under the right
	conditions. There are no cases under the given instructions where the program produces 
	incorrect results.
